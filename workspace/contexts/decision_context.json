You have to define a function execution_func(self) that performs the task, only define the function do not call it. Every kind of explanation should be included as python comments. Your entire response should be directly executable in a python shell.   You are given access to an API: In the following function that you can call target_pose is a list of 7 elements: the first 3 are x y z coordinates (in the world frame) and the last 4 are a quaternion representation of the gripper orientation  self.pick(target_pose, end_task=False): Moves the end effector to the specified position, with the specified orientation, and closes the gripper, picking up whatever object is at hand  self.place(target_pose, end_task=False): Moves the end effector to the specified position, with the specified orientation, and opens the gripper, placing whatever object is in the gripper  self.objStates: a dictionary with key-value pairs of the type \"<object-name>\":[x,y,z] that associate to each object perceived on the scene its 3d xyz coordinates expressed in the world frame  When you provide a solution, first write some comments where you divide the task in steps.  At each step you should write down the expected result in terms of spacial relationships among objects. Every time you move an object you should update some variables to keep track of the new state of the objects. When you execute the last pick or place action you chould always signal the end of the task by setting end_task to True.  Here are some examples on how to use the API to solve tasks:  Example 1 Task: Pick up the blue cube and place it in coordinates [0.7, 0.1, 0.05] Code:     def execution_func(self):         # 1. Pick the blue cube in PICK_POSITION         # 2. Place the cube in [0.7, 0.1, 0.05] -> the blue cube is now in [0.7, 0.1, 0.05]          objects = self.objStates         PICK_POSITION = objects[\"blue_cube\"]         PLACE_POSITION = [0.7, 0.1, 0.05]         # Append to the position also the quaternion that defines the orientation of the gripper         PICK_POSE = PICK_POSITION + [1,0,0,0]         PLACE_POSE = PLACE_POSITION + [1,0,0,0]          self.pick(PICK_POSITION)         # Last command --> end_task = True         self.place(PLACE_POSITION, end_task = True)         # Update state of the blue cube         objects[\"blue_cube\"] = [0.7, 0.1, 0.05]  Example 2 Task: Pick the yellow cube and put it on top of the blue one. The height of a block is 5cm. Code:     def execution_func(self):         # 1. Pick the yellow cube         # 2. Place the yellow cube on top of the blue cube. The bottom face of the yellow cube should touch the upper face of the blue one. So the center of the yellow cube needs to be directly above the center of the blue one, with an offset of BLOCK_HEIGHT on z -> The yellow cube is now directly above the the blue cube          objects = self.objStates         YELLOW_POSITION = objects[\"yellow_cube\"]         BLUE_POSITION = objects[\"blue_cube\"]         BLOCK_HEIGHT = 0.05 # expressed in meters         PICK_POSITION = YELLOW_POSITION         # Add an offset to the z component of the position of the blue cube in order to place the yellow cube on top         PLACE_POSITION = BLUE_POSITION[2] + BLOCK_HEIGHT         # Append to the position also the quaternion that defines the orientation of the gripper         PICK_POSE = PICK_POSITION + [1,0,0,0]         PLACE_POSE = PLACE_POSITION + [1,0,0,0]          self.pick(PICK_POSE)         # Last command --> end_task = True         self.place(PLACE_POSE, end_task = True)         objects[\"yellow_cube\"] = PLACE_POSITION   Additionally, the code you write is tested in a simulation and, if it fails to complete the task, you will be provided with the old code (that has failed) and a report from another bot that speculates on the possible reasons for failure. You are tasked to write another code that takes into account the suggestions from the report."
