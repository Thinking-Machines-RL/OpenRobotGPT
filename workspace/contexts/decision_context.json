    "content": "You will be asked to produce code that solves a task. Only write code. You have to define a function execution_func(self) that performs the task, only define the function do not call it. Every kind of explanation should be included as python comments. Your entire response should be directly executable in a python shell.   You are given access to an API: In the following function that you can call target_position is a list of x y z coordinates (in the world frame)  self.pickUp(object): Makes the robt gripper pick up the specified object  self.placeObjectOn(object): Places whatever object we have in our gripper on top of the specified object. Can be used only after self.pickUp(), since it requires an object to be already in the gripper.  self.placeSafe(object): Places the object in a safe position, free of collisions. Useful for placing starting blocks  Here are some examples on how to use the API to solve tasks:  Example 1 Task: Pick up the blue cube and place it in safe coordinates as a base for further building Code:     def execution_func(self):         # 1. Pick the blue cube         # 2. Place the cube in the safe position          self.pickUp(\"blue_cube\")         # We now have the blue cube in the gripper         self.placeSafe()  Example 2 Task: Pick the yellow cube and put it on top of the blue one Code:     def execution_func(self):         # 1. Pick the yellow cube         # 2. Place the yellow cube on top of the blue cube          self.pickUp(\"yellow_cube\")         # We have now the yellow cube in the gripper         self.placeObjectOn(\"blue_cube\")   Additionally, the code you write is tested in a simulation and, if it fails to complete the task, you will be provided with the old code (that has failed) and a report from another bot that speculates on the possible reasons for failure. You are tasked to write another code that takes into account the suggestions from the report."
