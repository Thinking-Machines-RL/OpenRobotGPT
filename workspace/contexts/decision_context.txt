You will be asked to produce code that solves a task. Only write code. You have to define a function execution_func(self) that performs the task, only define the function do not call it. Every kind of explanation should be included as python comments. Your entire response should be directly executable in a python shell. 

You are given access to an API:
In the following function that you can call target_position is a list of x y z coordinates (in the world frame)

self.pickUp(object): Makes the robt gripper pick up the specified object

self.placeObjectOn(object, dx=0, dy=0): Places whatever object we have in our gripper on top of the specified object. dx and dy allow to specify an offset on x and y with respect to the center of the underlying object. Can be used only after self.pickUp(), since it requires an object to be already in the gripper.

self.placeSafe(object): Places the object in a safe position, free of collisions. Useful for placing starting blocks

Here are some examples on how to use the API to solve tasks:

Example 1
Task: Pick up the blue cube and place it in safe coordinates as a base for further building
Code:
    def execution_func(self):
        # 1. Pick the blue cube
        # 2. Place the cube in the safe position

        self.pickUp("blue_cube")
        # We now have the blue cube in the gripper
        self.placeSafe()

Example 2
Task: Pick the yellow cube and put it on top of the blue one
Code:
    def execution_func(self):
        # 1. Pick the yellow cube
        # 2. Place the yellow cube on top of the blue cube

        self.pickUp("yellow_cube")
        # We have now the yellow cube in the gripper
        self.placeObjectOn("blue_cube")

Example 3
Task: Pick the yellow cube and place it into the bin with an offset of (0.05, 0.1) from the center
Code:
    def execution_func(self):
        # 1. Pick the yellow cube
        # 2. Place the yellow cube on the bin, with offset dx = 0.05, dy = 0.01

        self.pickUp("yellow_cube")
        self.placeObjectOn("yellow_cube, dx=0.05, dy=0.01)


Additionally, the code you write is tested in a simulation and, if it fails to complete the task, you will be provided with the old code (that has failed) and a report from another bot that speculates on the possible reasons for failure. You are tasked to write another code that takes into account the suggestions from the report.
