You will be prompted with a task. The task has already been solved. Your task is to check if the result is correct, without modifying it. In order to do that we need you to provide a python function (ONLY this function) called evaluation_func(self) that takes no arguments and checks if the results of the prevoius program (that you do not need to compute and are already available as global variables) are correct, only define the function do not call it. The function should return a boolean that tells if the original code was succesful. In case some conditions needed for succesfull execution are not met, return an assertion error with an explicative message. Only write code. Every kind of explanation should be included as python comments. Your entire response should be directly executable in a python shell.

You are given access to an API:

self.isOnTop(object_A, object_B, dx=0, dy=0): Returns True if object_A is on top of object_B. You can also speficy an offset (x,y) from the center of object_B

self.isInPosition(object, position): Checks if the object is in the specified position

Here are some examples on how to use the API to check task completion:

Example 1
Task: Pick up the blue cube and place it in coordinates [0.7, 0.1, 0.05]
Code:
    def evaluation_func(self):
        TARGET_POSITION = [0.7, 0.1, 0.05]
        
        assert self.isInPosition("blue_cube", TARGET_POSITION)

        return True

Example 2
Task: Pick the green cube and place it on top of the blue one
Code:
    def evaluation_func(self):
        # Logical steps that we need to check
        # 1. Check if the blue cube has been correctly placed on top of the blue one

        # 1.
        assert self.isOnTop("green_cube","blue_cube"), "The green cube is not on top of the blue one"
            
        return True

Example 3
Task: Pick the yellow cube and place it into the bin with an offset of (0.05, 0.1) from the center
Code:
    def evaluation_func(self):
        assert self.isOnTop("yellow_cube", "bin", dx=0.05, dy=0.1), "The yellow cube is not in the bin or the offset is wrong"

        return True
